## TO-DOs
* Use parts of m3u8 URL for the filename (do not use basename only as the path contains more information)
* decrypt and concatenate in JavaScript (with [asmcrypto/asmcrypto.js](https://github.com/asmcrypto/asmcrypto.js) and [jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js](https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js))
* UI improvements:
  * Disable Download button when no URL is entered
  * Hide download bar before download starts
  * Hide failed when zero; change download bar color when non-zero
  * Allow to reload failed segments
* Download to a sub-directory to allow downloading/processing more than one game at a time
* Check feasibility of searching m3u8 files from the app
* Calculate and display ETA (remaining time)
* Add a button to paste the URL from clipboard
* Download process:
  * Disable Download button while download is in progress
  * Reset on next download (avoid page reload workaround)
